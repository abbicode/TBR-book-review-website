    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Percy Jackson is a good kid, but he can't seem to focus on his schoolwork or control his temper. And lately, being away at boarding school is only getting worse - Percy could have sworn his pre-algebra teacher turned into a monster and tried to kill him. When Percy's mom finds out, she knows it's time that he knew the truth about where he came from, and that he go to the one place he'll be safe. <br><br>She sends Percy to Camp Half Blood, a summer camp for demigods (on Long Island), where he learns that the father he never knew is Poseidon, God of the Sea. Soon a mystery unfolds and together with his friendsâ€”one a satyr and the other the demigod daughter of Athena - Percy sets out on a quest across the United States to reach the gates of the Underworld (located in a recording studio in Hollywood) and prevent a catastrophic war between the gods.

    <h2>Review</h2>
    <p>5 stars <br><br>This is a unique book that encorporates greek mythology which makes the plot very interesting. The plot, characters, and writing are all well developed. I read this a while ago, but its so unforgetable I had to include a book review about it. Everything about it transports you to another world, which is why its so popular. Excited for the disney adaptation of this book!
