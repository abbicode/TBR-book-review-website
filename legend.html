    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>What was once the western United States is now home to the Republic, a nation perpetually at war with its neighbors. Born into an elite family in one of the Republic's wealthiest districts, fifteen-year-old June is a prodigy being groomed for success in the Republic's highest military circles. Born into the slums, fifteen-year-old Day is the country's most wanted criminal. But his motives may not be as malicious as they seem.<br><br>

From very different worlds, June and Day have no reason to cross pathsâ€”until the day June's brother, Metias, is murdered and Day becomes the prime suspect. Caught in the ultimate game of cat and mouse, Day is in a race for his family's survival, while June seeks to avenge Metias's death. But in a shocking turn of events, the two uncover the truth of what has really brought them together, and the sinister lengths their country will go to keep its secrets.

    <h2>Review</h2>
    <p>4.5 stars<br><br> I really like dystopian books, this specifically is very fast-paced and hard to put down. There are multiple narrators in this book, which makes it interesting to read. They both contrast eachother as June is in one of the wealthiest districts while Day is in slums. I find the characters loveable, which is a big reason why this book is rated so high. However, my only complaint is that the plot is a bit basic and similar to other dystopian concepts, which makes it a bit forgettable.
